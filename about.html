            <p>
              My fitness journey began in 2015 in Queens, New York when I was
              invited to Sunday workout sessions with my cousins. I was a tall,
              skinny kid with a wide frame, a physique with the potential to be
              great for body building. I was interested in gaining weight so
              this peaked my interest. Within a year, I started to see a lot of
              progress. Using the machines and free weights gave me an
              understanding of how form and added resistance builds strength and
              muscle.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being a college student I did not have the funds to get a full
              membership, so the rest of my days were spent training at the park
              or at home. Youtube was a highly rescourceful space for
              information, I started learning different ways to build muscle
              with just my body weight. Many of the videos I watched were of
              athletes within the five boroughs doing handstand pushups and
              muscle ups. From 2017-2019, I became focused on mastering these
              movements.

            <p>
              The more people that began asking me for tips on how to achieve my
              physique, the more I was compelled to find ways to help them. This
              was one of my major motivators when becoming a personal trainer.
              Working out in the park greatly influenced my personal training
              style. In my one on one sessions I utilized a blend of body weight
              and weighted movements to achieve my clients goals. Incorporating
              calisthenics in their training was a way for me to build a
              foundation for fundamental mobility and strength.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a stigma within the calisthenics community that some
              movements are more difficult for tall athletes. Being 6'2
              presented a challenge that I was determined to overcome. Using the
              resources in my home and at the nearby park, I began my
              hand-balancing journey.
